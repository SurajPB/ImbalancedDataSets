# ImbalancedDataSets

1. Most of the ML algorithms takes data is equally distributed
2. We are particualry interested in Minority class
3. Imbalance Degree : Ratio of minority class to Majority class
4. If sample size is small finding patterns inherent to the small class is very hard -- imbalanced dataset may not be a problem if the dataset is big enough
5. Class separability : If the classes are overlap each other then its hard to find the rules or boundaries that separate one class to another
6.
